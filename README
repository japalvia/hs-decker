MANAGE MY HEARTHSTONE COLLECTION
================================

This project is an experiment for managing Hearthstone decks for my personal
collection.

The plan
--------

Collect card data using https://hearthstonejson.com/
wget https://api.hearthstonejson.com/v1/latest/enUS/cards.collectible.json

Collect card images using https://github.com/schmich/hearthstone-card-images
The repo contains images and JSON mapping from card ID to image ID and also
direct github content URL. For now, pull the repo and use the data locally (the
usage terms forbids direct referring to github links and recommends local
caching in any case).

Collect my personal card collection as JSON data: find each card name and ID in
cards.collectible.json. Be careful when identifying the cards, there are many
with similar name or other variations. Look for the cost and text.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python-hearthstone module installed:
	https://github.com/HearthSim/python-hearthstone

Usage
-----

* Bootstrap card data once:
./src/bootstrap.py

* Every operation requires specifying the location of card data and your
  collection (when saved to disk):
  -c data/cards.collectible.json
  -m data/mycollection.json

* Add cards to your collection by:
  * their name,
  * a full expansion set or
  * from a list file where each line is in the format:
    [count] [card name]

  See full command syntax: ./src/hscollection.py add -h

* Remove a card by their name: ./src/hscollection.py remove [card name]

* Reset your collection to empty: ./src/hscollection.py --reset

* Display a deck using a deck string: ./src/hscollection.py deck [deck]
  This is useful when looking if a deck is feasible for crafting: each missing
  card is shown its cost and total cost of crafting required (based on your
  current collection.

  Example:
    ./src/hscollection.py -c data/cards.collectible.json -m data/mycollection.json \
	deck AAECAf0GBvIF4KwCoM4C+NACl9MC2OcCDNsGtgfECMwIm8IC3sQC38QC58sC8tACiNIC/OUC6OcCAA==
