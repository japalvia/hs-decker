MANAGE MY HEARTHSTONE COLLECTION
================================

This project is an experiment for managing Hearthstone decks for my personal
collection.

The plan
--------

Collect card data using https://hearthstonejson.com/
wget https://api.hearthstonejson.com/v1/latest/enUS/cards.collectible.json

Collect card images using https://github.com/schmich/hearthstone-card-images
The repo contains images and JSON mapping from card ID to image ID and also
direct github content URL. For now, pull the repo and use the data locally (the
usage terms forbids direct referring to github links and recommends local
caching in any case).

Collect my personal card collection as JSON data: find each card name and ID in
cards.collectible.json. Be careful when identifying the cards, there are many
with similar name or other variations. Look for the cost and text.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python-hearthstone module installed:
	https://github.com/HearthSim/python-hearthstone

Usage
-----

* Bootstrap card data once:
./src/bootstrap.py

* Generate JSON formatted collection from card list:
./src/hscollection.py \
    -c data/cards.collectible.json \
    -m data/mycollection.json \
    --list data/mycollection.txt

Cards are always added, delete mycollection.json when using single card list.

* Add JSON formatted card to collection by name and count:
./src/hscollection.py \
	-c data/cards.collectible.json \
	-m data/mycollection.json \
	--card "Arcane Missiles" --count 2
